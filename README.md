# Studies in Digital Signal Processing
#### This repository includes four projects focused on the study of Digital Signal Processing.

This repository features four projects exploring various aspects of Digital Signal Processing. Topics covered include the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), aliasing, magnitude and phase spectra, as well as the processing of images and ECG signals.

## Repository Structure
The repository contains four folders, each corresponding to a separate project. Each project is presented as a Python notebook, combining theoretical explanations with practical code implementations for a comprehensive study of the concepts.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.8

### Install dependencies
```sh
git clone https://github.com/akaTsunemori/signal-processing-studies.git

# Mudar o diretório corrente ao do repositório
cd signal-processing-studies

# Criar ambiente conteinerizado
python3 -m venv venv

# Ativar o ambiente criado
source ./venv/bin/activate

# Instalar dependências
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To get started, open any folder, and you’ll find a Python notebook with the complete project inside.

## Contributing
Feel free to open issues to this project, any kind of contributions are greatly appreciated.

## Ackowledgements
We extend our gratitude to Professor Eduardo Peixoto from the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Brasília for his invaluable lectures and the materials he provided.
